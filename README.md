# Amplify

## About

**Amplify is a full-stack web application that analyzes a user's top played songs to generate artist-specific song recommendations.**

Recommendations are generated by analyzing the audio features of a user's top played tracks over the last month. When a user searches for an artist, the user's data is compared to all songs in the artist's discography. The 5 songs by that artist that best match the user's music taste are returned.

Additional features:

- Recommendations can be filtered to only display result from specific artist albums.
- Search results for an artist also display related artists.
- Each song recommendation links to Spotify so that the song can be played on Spotify.
